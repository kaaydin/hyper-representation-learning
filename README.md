# Model Zoo for Language Transformers 

## Introduction 

Neural Networks (NNs) evolve on unique trajectories in weight space during training - depending on hyperparameters and weight initialization - leading to different model parameters (i.e., weights & biases) & minima on the loss surface. A population of NNs (or a model zoo) can form structures in weight space that contain information about the state of training and can reveal latent properties of individual models (e.g., accuracy). With model zoos, we can investigate novel approaches for a variety of use cases, such as model analysis, discovering learning dynamics & generative modelling of NNs. 

for our project, we will look at Language Transformers, focusing on BERT.
